* Nar downloads no longer work ... because the router takes over the .nar link
* Make sure the tools work as closely as possible to the standard nifi processors:

* table 
** tabs for columns
** tables don't work too well.
* a lot of nars are getting registered as artifactid: nifi-standard-services-api-nar
* make github project name consitant with nf2t and node package.json
* Home Page: says flowfile tools - nifi flowfile tools repetative
* Button based filters on tables in Group vs selector
* Upload to the tool time?
* Upload buttons without persistant file state instead of file input?
* Attributes / Attributes name confusion. Unique vs non-Unique. use that language.
* Pressing NAR buttons doesn't always work.
* FlowFile Tools - Attribute Item is broken (confirm fix worked)
* Downloading the example flow files one by one isn't tha fun
* Is there an alternative to renderToString??? https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToString#removing-rendertostring-from-the-client-code
* Lookup all attributes on link:https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/main/nifi-extension-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/standard/GetFile.java[]
* Fix issue with lazy loaded routes, they can't export anything else!! no searchParam declerations
* https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/custom-editors
* Add download all button that works without showDirectoryPicker API
* Remove React Router Debug menu
* Convert home -> homeRoute (as well as lazy loaders)...
* Download FlowFile still works after clear. Something to do with method setState.
* See if its possible to add nars to a persistant localstorage...
* Build Info in NextPrev doesn't work... Honestly the RouteDescription thing may be too complicated...
* Use regular manifest in readNar but also seperate extensionManifest / regularManifest / javascriptFile attributes in zod object...
* Make sure PWA works on Chrome.
* See if its possible to do the title / descriptions different for each route.: https://tanstack.com/router/latest.
* Update name of Source to Nf2tSource, any anything else that looks generic.
* Make a better Nf2t logo. Possibly the MUI Icon?
