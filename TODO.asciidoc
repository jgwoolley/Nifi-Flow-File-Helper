* Add more references to the CLI.

* Make sure the tools work as closely as possible to the standard nifi processors:
** mime.type for packaged FlowFile must be the standardFlowFile type. It is always overwritten, assumes another process would write to it. Basically all properties should be scoped as Nf2t properties.

** Package could work as an array of files like Unpackager. All flowfiles could be grouped together.

* Nf2t Unpack
** Add JSZip unpacking option.
** Think about making unpacks not happining automatically but allow clicking and selecting to do this. Maybe make a table selection option for performaing actions?

* Nf2t Lib
** Remove id logic in unpackageFlowFile, it is not necissary
** Make a read only version of unpackageFlowFile so order of list entries perserved, as well as direct object

* Nf2t Table 
** Tried to implement in NewNf2tTable @tanstack/react-table. Remove import if it doesn't work.
** tabs for columns
** tables don't work too well.
** Nf2t Table: regex filter does not work, only allowed to select full matches
** Button based filters on tables in Group vs selector (not exactly sure what this means)

* Nf2t Nar Tool
** Nar downloads no longer work ... because the router takes over the .nar link
** a lot of nars are getting registered as artifactid: nifi-standard-services-api-nar
** Pressing NAR buttons doesn't always work.
** Downloading the example flow files one by one isn't tha fun
** Use regular manifest in readNar but also seperate extensionManifest / regularManifest / javascriptFile attributes in zod object...

* Nf2t Unpack / Pack Consistancy
** Upload buttons without persistant file state instead of file input?
** Attributes / Attributes name confusion. Unique vs non-Unique. use that language.
* Add download all button that works without showDirectoryPicker API. Possibly with ZIP?
* Download FlowFile still works after clear. Something to do with method setState.

* Home
** says flowfile tools - nifi flowfile tools repetative

* Unsorted
** Update name of Source to Nf2tSource, any anything else that looks generic.
** Make a better Nf2t logo. Possibly the MUI Icon?
** make github project name consitant with nf2t and node package.json
** Upload to the tool time?
** FlowFile Tools - Attribute Item is broken (confirm fix worked)
** Is there an alternative to renderToString??? https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToString#removing-rendertostring-from-the-client-code
** Lookup all attributes on link:https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/main/nifi-extension-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/standard/GetFile.java[]
** Fix issue with lazy loaded routes, they can't export anything else!! no searchParam declerations
** https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/custom-editors
** Convert home -> homeRoute (as well as lazy loaders)...
** See if its possible to add nars to a persistant localstorage...
** Build Info in NextPrev doesn't work... Honestly the RouteDescription thing may be too complicated...
** Make sure PWA works on Chrome.
** See if its possible to do the title / descriptions different for each route.: https://tanstack.com/router/latest.
