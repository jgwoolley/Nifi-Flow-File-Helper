== Required Software

- NodeJS
- Git

== TODO
- Button based filters on tables in Group vs selector
- Upload to the tool time?
- Upload buttons without persistant file state instead of file input?
- Attributes / Attributes name confusion. Unique vs non-Unique. use that language.
- Pressing NAR buttons doesn't always work.
- FlowFile Tools - Attribute Item is broken (confirm fix worked)
- Downloading the example flow files one by one isn't tha fun
- Is there an alternative to renderToString??? https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToString#removing-rendertostring-from-the-client-code
- Lookup all attributes on https://github.com/apache/nifi/blob/main/nifi-extension-bundles/nifi-standard-bundle/nifi-standard-processors/src/main/java/org/apache/nifi/processors/standard/GetFile.java
- Fix issue with lazy loaded routes, they can't export anything else!! no searchParam declerations
- https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/custom-editors
- Add download all button that works without showDirectoryPicker API
- Remove React Router Debug menu
- Convert home -> homeRoute (as well as lazy loaders)...
- Download FlowFile still works after clear. Something to do with method setState.
- See if its possible to add nars to a persistant localstorage...
- Build Info in NextPrev doesn't work... Honestly the RouteDescription thing may be too complicated...
- Use regular manifest in readNar but also seperate extensionManifest / regularManifest / javascriptFile attributes in zod object...
- Make sure PWA works on Chrome.
- See if its possible to do the title / descriptions different for each route.: https://tanstack.com/router/latest.
- Update name of Source to Nf2tSource, any anything else that looks generic.
- Make a better Nf2t logo. Possibly the MUI Icon?
