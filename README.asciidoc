## TODO

- Change Nifi Attributes to be represented as Record<string,string>
- Add Filters to attribute tables.
- Add ability to download bulk unpackaged.
- See if its possible to add nars to a persistant localstorage...
- Larger restructor of routes
    - More things will probably need to be renamed.
    - Possibly use dynamic import(). Will need seperate files for lazy loading...
    - LookupAttribute -> LookupAttributes, all other lookups only look one thing up...
- See why Extensions are duplicating.
- Use regular manifest in readNar but also seperate extensionManifest / regularManifest / javascriptFile attributes in zod object...
- Make sure PWA works on Chrome.
- See if its possible to do the title / descriptions different for each route.: https://tanstack.com/router/latest.
- Move project info to asciidocs.
- Update Source to Nf2tSource, any anything else that looks generic.
- Create Nf2t logo.
