## TODO

- Convert home -> homeRoute (as well as lazy loaders)...
- New page for list of nars, and then seperate page for list of attribute names.
- Download FlowFile still works after clear. Something to do with method setState.
- Change Nifi Attributes to be represented as Record<string,string>
- Add Filters to attribute tables.
- Add ability to download bulk unpackaged.
- See if its possible to add nars to a persistant localstorage...
- Build Info in NexxtPrev doesn't work... Honestly the RouteDescription thing may be too complicated...
- See why Extensions are duplicating.
- Use regular manifest in readNar but also seperate extensionManifest / regularManifest / javascriptFile attributes in zod object...
- Make sure PWA works on Chrome.
- See if its possible to do the title / descriptions different for each route.: https://tanstack.com/router/latest.
- Move project info to asciidocs.
- Update Source to Nf2tSource, any anything else that looks generic.
- Create Nf2t logo.
